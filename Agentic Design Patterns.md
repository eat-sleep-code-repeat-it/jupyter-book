1. Planner–Executor
User → Planner Agent → (Step 1) → Executor Agent
                         ↓             ↓
                       (Step 2) → (Tool Calls / LLM)

2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Research Agent ↔ Writer Agent ↔ Critic Agent
     ↑                                ↓
     └────── Coordinator Agent ──────┘

3. Graph-Based Pattern (LangGraph)
User Input
   ↓
[Preprocessor Node]
   ↓
[Planner Node] ─→ [Tool Node] ─→ [LLM Node]
   ↑                             ↓
[Memory Node] ←── [Reflection / Retry Node]

4. Autonomous Agent Loop

Goal → Think → Plan → Act → Observe → Repeat

✨ Why Use Agentic Design Patterns?

Modularity: Easier to reason about and test components.

Scalability: Add/remove agents or tools as needed.

Composability: Build higher-order workflows from smaller parts.

Traceability: You can trace decisions across steps or agents.

Statefulness: Enable memory, context tracking, retries, etc.
